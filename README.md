This is a local password manager.
It WON'T protect you from specialized reverse engineers, but it is meant to keep your passwords organized and helps ease the gathering of sensitive information for many things you may need with a lock.
This is a base level security app for if there are too many passwords to manage and you want to keep them out of your browser or easily accessible notes. This is mainly aimed for consumers, not for companies or corporations unless updated to such ranges.

More updates may come.
